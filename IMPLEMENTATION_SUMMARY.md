# Implementation Summary: CEL to Hooks System Migration

## Overview

Successfully replaced the CEL-based post-request transformer with a generic, flexible hook system that supports both pre-request and post-request command execution with configurable retry policies.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. API Changes (CRD Updates)

**File:** `api/v1alpha1/externalsource_types.go`

- ✅ Removed `Transform` and `TransformSpec` types

### 4. Controller Updates

### 5. Configuration Updates

**Files:**
- `internal/config/config.go`
- `internal/config/configmap.go`

- ✅ Removed `TransformConfig`
- ✅ Added `HooksConfig` with:
  - `WhitelistPath`

### 6. Metrics Updates

**Files:**

- ✅ Replaced `RecordTransformation()` with `RecordHookExecution()`
- ✅ Added hook-specific metrics:
  - `externalsource_hook_execution_total`
  - `externalsource_hook_execution_duration_seconds`
- ✅ Updated all metrics tests

### 7. Code Removal

- ✅ Deleted `internal/transformer/cel.go`
- ✅ Deleted `internal/transformer/cel_test.go`
- ✅ Deleted `internal/transformer/interface.go`
- ✅ Removed CEL dependency from `go.mod`
- ✅ Ran `go mod tidy`

### 8. Deployment Manifests

**Files:**
- `config/manager/manager.yaml`
- `config/manager/hooks-whitelist.yaml`
- `config/manager/kustomization.yaml`

- ✅ Added hook-executor sidecar container
- ✅ Created hook whitelist ConfigMap
- ✅ Added environment variables for hook configuration
- ✅ Mounted whitelist ConfigMap in both containers
- ✅ Configured health probes for sidecar

### 9. Examples

**Files:**
- `examples/hooks-example.yaml` (new)
- `examples/data-transformation.yaml` (updated)

- ✅ Created comprehensive hooks examples
- ✅ Updated data-transformation examples to use jq instead of CEL
- ✅ Demonstrated all retry policies
- ✅ Showed multi-step hook chains

### 10. Tests

**File:** `internal/controller/externalsource_controller_test.go`

- ✅ Created `MockHookExecutor`
- ✅ Replaced all `MockTransformer` references
- ✅ Updated all test cases
- ✅ Tests compile and pass

### 11. Documentation

**Files:**
- `MIGRATION.md` (new)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
- `cmd/hook-executor/README.md` (new)

- ✅ Created comprehensive migration guide
- ✅ Documented CEL to jq expression mapping
- ✅ Added deployment and troubleshooting guides
- ✅ Provided migration examples

## Architecture

### System Flow

```
ExternalSource Resource
    ↓
Controller (with HookExecutor)
    ↓ HTTP Request
Hook-Executor Sidecar
    ↓ Validates against whitelist
Executes whitelisted command
    ↓ Returns stdout/stderr
Controller processes result
    ↓
Next hook in chain or package artifact
```

### Retry Logic

- Each `ExternalSource` has a `maxRetries` limit (default: 3)
- Each hook has a `retryPolicy`:
  - **fail** (default): Stop on error
  - **retry**: Retry on error, count against maxRetries
  - **ignore**: Continue on error, don't count against maxRetries
- Retries are tracked in aggregate across all hooks
- Exponential backoff between retries

### Security Model

1. **Whitelist-First**: Only explicitly allowed commands can execute
2. **Argument Validation**: Optional regex patterns to restrict arguments
3. **Sidecar Isolation**: Commands run in a separate container
4. **No Shell Expansion**: Direct command execution, no shell interpretation
5. **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory limits on sidecar container

## Breaking Changes

Users must migrate from CEL to hooks:

1. Replace `spec.transform` with `spec.hooks.postRequest`
2. Convert CEL expressions to jq commands
3. Add `spec.maxRetries` if custom retry behavior is needed
4. Deploy updated controller with sidecar
5. Create and mount whitelist ConfigMap

## Verification

All components build successfully:

```bash
✓ make manifests generate
✓ go build ./...
✓ go mod tidy
✓ Tests updated and pass
```

## Files Modified

- API: 1 file
- Internal packages: 15 files
- CMD: 4 files (new)
- Config: 4 files
- Examples: 2 files
- Tests: 2 files  
- Documentation: 2 files (new)
- Total: ~30 files

## Next Steps

1. Update integration tests to test hook execution
2. Add e2e tests with actual hook-executor sidecar
3. Update Helm chart to include sidecar configuration
4. Create tutorial videos/blog posts
5. Update project README with hooks examples

## Notes

- Backward compatibility: **Breaking change** - users must migrate
- Performance: Hooks add minimal overhead (HTTP call to localhost)
- Flexibility: Hooks support any command-line tool
- Security: Whitelist provides strong security boundary
- Observability: Comprehensive metrics for hook execution
